This files has been created during the Coursera course: An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, ministred by Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner and Stephen Wong.\r\n\r\nVideo games aren't just fun, they can be powerful vehicles for learning as well. Video games are one of the fastest trending topics in media, education, and technology. Research across fields as disparate as science, literacy, history, visual processing, curriculum, and computer science suggests that video games aren't just fun, they can actually be good for your mind as well.\r\n\r\n### My Goals\r\n\r\nThese programs are designed to be a fun introduction to the basics of programming in Python. The focus will be on building simple games such as Pong, Blackjack and Asteroids. All files posted here were create for the the Coursera course 'An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python'. The focus will be on building simple games such as Pong, Blackjack and Asteroids.\r\n\r\nThese files were designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.  My language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, I use a new browser-based programming environment ([codeskultor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/)) that makes developing interactive applications in Python really simple.  These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
