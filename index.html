<p>Just for fun, because having fun is the best way to learn. This files has been created during the Coursera course: An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, ministred by Joe Warren, Scott Rixner, John Greiner and Stephen Wong.</p>

<p>This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.  Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.  These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse. </p>

<p>The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through multiple "mini-projects" in Python.  To make this class enjoyable, these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack, and Asteroids.  When you’ve finished our course, we can’t promise that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you’re doing it. </p>
